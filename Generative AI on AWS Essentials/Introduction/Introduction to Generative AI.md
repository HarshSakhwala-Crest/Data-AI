# Introduction to Generative AI

## Key Takeaways

## What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music.

## What are foundation models?
Generative AI is powered by very large machine learning models that are pretrained on vast collections of data and are commonly referred to as foundation models (FMs).

### Types of Foundation Models:
- **Text-to-Text** – Summarization, content creation, Q&A (e.g., auto-complete).  
- **Text-to-Embeddings** – Enhances search accuracy.  
- **Multimodal** – Generates images from text input.  

## Amazon’s ML Expertise
- 20+ years in AI/ML with 100K+ customers.  
- Amazon uses ML to power the following:
**Ecommerce recommendations engines**
**Fulfillment center optimizations**
**Supply chain, forecasting, and capacity planning**
**Prime Air drone delivery**
**Computer vision technology in Amazon Go**
