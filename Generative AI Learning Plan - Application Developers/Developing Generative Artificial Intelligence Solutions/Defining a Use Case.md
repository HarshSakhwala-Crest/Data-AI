# Defining a Use Case  

## Importance of a Well-Defined Use Case  
The first stage in the generative AI lifecycle involves:  
âœ… **Defining the problem** to be solved.  
âœ… **Gathering relevant requirements** from stakeholders.  
âœ… **Aligning expectations** to ensure project success.  

## Components of a Business Use Case  
A business use case outlines how a system should behave and includes:  

- **Use Case Name** â€“ A short, descriptive identifier.  
- **Brief Description** â€“ High-level summary of purpose & objective.  
- **Actors** â€“ Entities interacting with the system (e.g., customers, employees, external systems).  
- **Preconditions** â€“ Conditions that must be met before execution.  
- **Basic Flow** â€“ Step-by-step success scenario.  
- **Alternative Flows** â€“ Handling exceptions or errors.  
- **Postconditions** â€“ Conditions that must be met after execution.  
- **Business Rules** â€“ Policies & constraints affecting behavior.  
- **Nonfunctional Requirements** â€“ Performance, security, usability, etc.  
- **Assumptions** â€“ Context or system dependencies.  
- **Additional Notes** â€“ Extra information for clarity.
