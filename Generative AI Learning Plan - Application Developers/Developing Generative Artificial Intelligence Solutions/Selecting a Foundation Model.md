# Selecting a Foundation Model (FM)  

## Importance of FM Selection  
Choosing the right **foundation model (FM)** impacts the performance, efficiency, and scalability of a generative AI application. Businesses must decide between:  
- **Pre-trained Models** â€“ Faster deployment, but may need fine-tuning & have biases.  
- **Custom Models** â€“ Built from scratch, requiring extensive data & resources.  

## **Pre-trained Model Selection Criteria**  
âœ… **Cost** â€“ Licensing, computational expenses, & fine-tuning costs.  
âœ… **Modality** â€“ Supports text, image, audio, or multimodal generation.  
âœ… **Latency** â€“ Real-time vs. batch processing needs.  
âœ… **Multi-Lingual Support** â€“ Ability to generate content in multiple languages.  
âœ… **Model Size** â€“ Balancing complexity with resource availability.  
âœ… **Model Complexity** â€“ Advanced models for complex tasks vs. simpler models for efficiency.  
âœ… **Customization** â€“ Fine-tuning options for domain-specific performance.  
âœ… **Input/Output Length** â€“ Handling long-form content or extensive inputs.  
âœ… **Responsible AI Considerations** â€“ Bias, misinformation risks, and ethical impact.  
âœ… **Deployment & Integration** â€“ Compatibility with infrastructure & existing tools.
