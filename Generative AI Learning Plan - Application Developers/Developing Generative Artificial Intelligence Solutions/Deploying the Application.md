# Deploying a Generative AI Application  

## Importance of Deployment  
The **deployment phase** ensures that a trained **foundation model (FM)** is successfully integrated into the target environment while considering **scalability, security, and user experience.**

## **Key Deployment Considerations**  

### âœ… **Cost**  
- AWS offers a **pay-as-you-go** model with no minimum fees.  

### âœ… **Regions**  
- Model deployment is **limited to specific AWS Regions**â€”verify availability.  

### âœ… **Quotas**  
- Ensure **adequate service quotas** for AWS resources before deployment.  

### âœ… **Security**  
- **AWS-hosted models:** Security responsibility is **shared** between AWS & the organization.  
- **Externally accessed models:** Evaluate **data security risks** for information leaving AWS infrastructure.
