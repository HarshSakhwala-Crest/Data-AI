# **Prompt Engineering Techniques**  

## **1️⃣ Zero-Shot Prompting**  
🔹 Task is presented **without examples**—relies on model’s general knowledge.  
🔹 Works best with **large, instruction-tuned models** (RLHF enhances performance).  

### **Example: Zero-Shot Prompt**  
📌 **Prompt:**  
*"Tell me the sentiment of the following social media post (positive, negative, or neutral):*  
*Huge shoutout to the amazing team at AnyCompany! Your customer service is incredible!"*  

✅ **Output:** *Positive*

## **2️⃣ Few-Shot Prompting**  
🔹 Provides **one or more examples** to guide AI towards expected outputs.  
🔹 Helps model **generalize patterns** for better task understanding.  

### **Example: Few-Shot Prompt**  
📌 **Prompt:**  
*"Tell me the sentiment of the following news headline. Here are some examples:"*  

- *"Investment firm fends off corruption allegations"* → **Negative**  
- *"Local teacher awarded with national prize"* → **Positive**  
- *"Community organization exceeds fundraising goal, feeding thousands"* → ❓  

✅ **Output:** *Positive*

## **3️⃣ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**  
🔹 **Breaks down complex reasoning tasks** into intermediate steps.  
🔹 Works with **both zero-shot & few-shot prompting.**  
🔹 Use **"Think step by step"** to trigger logical reasoning.  

### **Example: Zero-Shot CoT Prompt**  
📌 **Prompt:**  
*"Which service requires a larger deposit?"*  
- *Service A costs $50,000 (30% deposit required).*  
- *Service B costs $40,000 (40% deposit required).*  
- *Think step by step.*  

✅ **Output:**  
- **Service A:** 30% of $50,000 = **$15,000**  
- **Service B:** 40% of $40,000 = **$16,000**  
- **Conclusion:** Service B requires a larger deposit.

### **Example: Few-Shot CoT Prompt**  
📌 **Prompt:**  
*Question: If there are 2 bags with 3 oranges each, how many oranges are there in total?*  
✅ *Answer: 2 bags, 3 oranges each. 2 × 3 = 6 oranges.*

✅ *Answer: 4 × 2 = 8 passengers.*  

*Question: If there are 3 baskets, each with 5 apples, how many apples are there?*  
✅ *Answer: Think step by step*
